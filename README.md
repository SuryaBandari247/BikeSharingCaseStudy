## Conclusions
> season vs cnt:
> -	Season 3 which is the fall has maximum number of bookings. (Season 3>2>4>1)
> year vs cnt:
> -	2019 has a greater number of bookings than previous year which is a good sign of company's growth.
> Month vs cnt
> -	Total number of bookings are more during May-Sep/Oct but then there is a noticeable drop. Same observed during univariate analysis
> Week vs cnt
> -	Total number of bookings mostly same for all the days in week. There is little more demand on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Little less on Sunday.
> weathersit vs cnt:
> -	'1' which represent clear or partly cloudy weather has more bookings. (Weathersit-1>2>3)
> holiday vs cnt:
> -	During the holidays, there is a dip in total number of bookings, if you compare 25-50 percentile.
> workingday vs cnt:
> -	 Workingday or not, they is no noticeable different.
> Final model from linear regression:
> - total_bookings(cnt) = 0.0750 + 0.2331 * (year) + 0.0561 * (workingday) + 0.5499 * (temp) - 0.1552 * (windspeed) + 0.0886 * (season_summer) + 0.1307 * (season_winter) -0.0800 * (weathersit_2) - 0.2871 * (weatthersit_3) + 0.0974 * (mnth_sep) + 0.0675 * (weekend_6)
